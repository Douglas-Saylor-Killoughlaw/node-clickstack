Node.js support on CloudBees. A Work In Progress.

This should work with standard node.js apps, but as it is a WIP - please do ask any questions on
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cloudbees-dev as we flesh it out.


To use: 

clone this repo
cd sampleapp
zip -r ../app.zip *

bees app:deploy -a playground/node -t node -RPLUGIN.SRC.node=https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudbees-downloads/clickstack/node-clickstack.zip ../app.zip 

You can see this running at node.playground.cloudbees.net

Notes: 
It looks for a main.js by default. You can set a config variable of "main_js" to override this.
If a package.json is present, it will install the packages via npm.

Node version 0.8.11 at present.
